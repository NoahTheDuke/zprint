# How map keys are formatted

### Sorted

By default, zprint will output maps with keys in sorted order.

```clojure
(def map1 {:a :A :b :B :c :C :d :D :f :F :g :G :h :H :i :I :j :J :k :K :l :L :m :M})

(clojure.pprint/pprint map1)

{:m :M,
 :l :L,
 :k :K,
 :g :G,
 :c :C,
 :j :J,
 :h :H,
 :b :B,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :i :I,
 :a :A}

(czprint map1)

{:a :A,
 :b :B,
 :c :C,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :g :G,
 :h :H,
 :i :I,
 :j :J,
 :k :K,
 :l :L,
 :m :M}
```

### Ordered

You can specify your own ordering of map keys with an options map:
```clojure
(czprint map1 {:map {:key-order [:k :i :m]}})

{:k :K,
 :i :I,
 :m :M,
 :a :A,
 :b :B,
 :c :C,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :g :G,
 :h :H,
 :j :J,
 :l :L}
```

### Ignored

You can use `:key-ignore` or `:key-ignore-silent` to get keys elided from
map output:

```clojure
(czprint map1 {:map {:key-ignore-silent [:k :i :m]} :width 50})

{:a :A,
 :b :B,
 :c :C,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :g :G,
 :h :H,
 :j :J,
 :l :L}
```

### Colored

There are two additional options for maps that can be useful:

#####  `:key-color` 

The value of `:key-color` is a map which relates keys that are
'constants' to a color in which to print that key.  A constant is
a keyword, string, or number.  This way you can have some keys
formatted in a color that is different from the color in which they
would normally be formatted based on their type.  It can go well
with `:key-order [:key1 :key2 ...]` which is another way to distinguish
a special key.  You can place some keys at the front of the map and
you can also adjust their colors to meet your needs.

```
(czprint map1 {:map {:key-color {:k :blue}}})

; You can't see the colors because markdown loses the colors
; but you can see how to do it.

{:a :A,
 :b :B,
 :c :C,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :g :G,
 :h :H,
 :i :I,
 :j :J,
 :k :K,
 :l :L,
 :m :M}
```


#####  `:key-value-color` 

The value of `:key-value-color` is a map which relates keys (that
don't have to be constants) to a color-map which is merged into the
current color-map, and is used when formatting the __value__ of that key.
This way you can have the values of some keys formatted in a color that
is different from the color in which they would normally be formatted
based on their type.

```
(czprint map1 {:map {:key-value-color {:k {:keyword :green}}}})

; You can't see the colors because markdown loses the colors
; but you can see how to do it.

{:a :A,
 :b :B,
 :c :C,
 :d :D,
 :f :F,
 :g :G,
 :h :H,
 :i :I,
 :j :J,
 :k :K,
 :l :L,
 :m :M}
``` 

You can place these option maps on individual calls.  If you
are operating at the REPL, using `set-options!` is frequently a good way
to set up useful formatting.  For more enduring changes,
this options map can appear
[anywhere an options map is accepted]
